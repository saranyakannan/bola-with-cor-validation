## Overview

The Chain of Responsibility (COR) pattern allows you to build a flexible and extensible validation system by chaining together different validation steps. In this example, we demonstrate how to use the COR pattern to validate various aspects of Account and User objects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-cor-validation-example.git 
   ```
   2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
  

### Usage
To see the COR pattern in action, run the Main.java class. This class performs validation on different combinations of Account and User objects. You can customize the validation logic and validator chain as needed for your specific use case.
